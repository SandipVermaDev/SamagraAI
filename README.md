# SamagraAI â€“ Multimodal Chat Assistant ðŸ§ âœ¨

SamagraAI is a Flutter-based chat application backed by a FastAPI service that blends LLM chat (Gemini), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) over uploaded PDFs and OCRâ€™ed images, and streaming responses. This repo contains both the Flutter app (`samagra_app/`) and the Python backend (`samagra_backend/`).

- Frontend: Flutter (Material 3, Provider) with speech input, attachments, streaming markdown rendering, light/dark themes.
- Backend: FastAPI with LangChain, FAISS vector store, Google Generative AI (Gemini) for chat + embeddings, OCR via Google Vision with EasyOCR fallback.
